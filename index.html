      <h4>Austria -> HRE</h4>
      <p>We start our journey with King ___ the Uniter. King ___ seeing the loss of Bohemia and Hungary after the death of ___, King ___ was determined to bring these lands back under Hapsberg control. However as the Holy Roman Emporer it he also knew his responsibility to the German peoples. Thus solidifying alliances within the empire was the first action King __ took in 1444. Being that Austria was not an elector, the alliances began with Brandenburg, Maines and the Paltinate. The next aim was then to imporve relations with the remaining electors and building a grand army. Having assumed good relations with the Germans, King ___ set out on the the first of the unification wars, with Bohemia.</p> 
      <p>The Austrian Army, a mainly infantry force had the luxury o being able to replace the manpower of the economically more efficient infantry army it supported. The calvery arms of the other German princes were always the noble's perfered unit, a elite unit for which the prince could at least hope to fight abover their weight class with. Looking foward King ___ took the opposite and demanded that his army be drilled with mass infantry tactics first. We thus see in the Austro-Bohemian unification war, the foward thinking of that decision. In the opening days of the war the Austrian army rushed towards Prague catching half the Bohemian army training on the way. The battle was swift and the Bohemian army perminatly crippled. Now with far less troops than the Austrians forts around the nation were quickly seized or layed seige to. The reminants of the Bohemian army and those of their vassals, launched a lash desperate assult on the outlying areas of the Austrian empire, taking ___ to open a path to Wein. However before they even got to Weins gates, the peace had already been signed, with the next meeting between the armies being as brothers in the next war.</p>
      <p>With the union with Bohemia, Austria had become the greatest force within the Holy Roman Empire. It was due to his new position that the other rulers of Europe took notice, however only the Burgundy, who sought to control the western German states to unite its land, decided to chalange this new great protector of the HRE. The Austor-Bergundian war for the Alps thus began with the Burgundian army retracing the steps of the Bohemian army, however, unlike the Bohemians the Burgundians failed to even get near to Wein. This is in no small part due to the aid from the other German States. At the onset of war the war counsel of the Holy Coalition of German states, which was in fact only made up of the alliance network of Austria, decided a decisive strike against the Burgundian as they exited there sphere followed by a rush towards their low lands holdings would be the plan of attack. </p>
